## Simulation Conclusion
By following the steps involved in a simulation study, we were able to successfully simulate and improve
a given system. Our team managed to thoroughly investigate each aspect of the model and implement
the simulation into software using Java. The result of the simulation is that we found that the original
routing policy blocked inspector 2 after the initialization phase since neither workstations 2 or 3 were
able to receive the first component to finish building the product. This resulted in Inspector 2 being
utilized only 20% of the time. We decided to change the policy to prioritize workstations 3 and 2 over
workstation 1. The changed policy improved the utilization of inspector 2, increasing the utilization
percentage from 20% to 96%.
